# GraduationProject

Hello, my name is Evgeniy! I am a beginner iOS developer.

I am finishing the development course and I want to present my graduation project, which I plan to expand and use as a pet-project in the future.

The essence of the application is that everyone can try on the role of a bartender. At the moment when a person wants to drink something delicious and he is ready to try his hand at it, he can open the application, choose a cocktail, and, following the instructions, make it.

The architecture I used is MVC.
I built the interface using UIKit and using storyboards. Some objects were written in code. Initially I thought it was difficult for me, but then I realized the efficiency and convenience of working in this way. I made Internet requests using the URLSession, and uploaded images via Alamofire. Realm was used to store selected cocktails. And I also used SwiftyOnboard to write onboarding.

# Along the way of writing, of course, I faced a huge number of problems due to the first experience

But I've never given up on finding a solution. Perseverance played a primary role here!


# Thank you to all involved!
